    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This kale sweet potato salad has something for everyone—sweet, salty, crunchy, tangy—and your mom will be so happy you are eating kale! Roast the sweet potato and onion a day ahead, if you like, to save time.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sweet potato</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 strips bacon</li>
        <li>1 bunch kale</li>
        <li>1 Granny Smith apple - cored and diced</li>
        <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dresing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raw, unsalted sunflower seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup bacon grease or other oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 12 x18-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
       <li>Peel and dice sweet potato into 3/4-inch pieces, about 2 cups, and place in a bowl. Dice onion into 3/4-inch pieces and add to sweet potatoes. Add olive oil; season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Spread vegetables in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
       <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are fork tender, but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally. Remove from heat, crumble, and set aside. Reserve bacon fat and allow to cool, but do not refrigerate.</li>
       <li>Remove tough stems from kale, rinse well, and place in a colander to drain. Lightly press kale with paper towels to assist with drying.</li>
       <li>Cut kale into bite-sized pieces and place in a large salad bowl. Add cooled sweet potatoes and onions, apple, and green onions.</li>
       <li>To make dressing, place reserved bacon fat, about 1/4 cup, in a pint jar with a well-fitting lid. If you don't have enough bacon fat, add enough oil to get to 1/4 cup. Add vinegar, mustard, honey, and salt and pepper, to taste. Attach the lid and shake vigorously to combine.</li>
       <li>Pour dressing over salad, and toss. Sprinkle crumbled bacon over salad, and garnish with sunflower seeds.</li>
    </ol>
